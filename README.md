## Introduction

**Fancy Action Sheet** is a customizable and flexible action sheet component for React Native. This component is easy to integrate, highly customizable, and comes with support for both standard and destructive actions.

## Installation

Install the package via **NPM**:

```bash
npm install fancy-action-sheet
```
..or via **Yarn**:
```bash
yarn add fancy-action-sheet
```

## Dependencies

### React Native
This package was created to be used exclusively with a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) app project.

Specifically, this package requires the following **peer dependencies** to be installed in your project:

`React: >=17.0.0`<br />
`React Native: >=0.68.0`

Since this package is used within a React Native project these depencencies should already be installed.<br />
‚ö†Ô∏è Only install them manually **if they are NOT already installed** for some reason:

```bash
npm install react react-native
```

## Usage

Wrap your app in the `FancyActionSheetProvider` and use the `useFancyActionSheet` hook to control the action sheet.

### Basic Example

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';
import { FancyActionSheetProvider, useFancyActionSheet } from 'fancy-action-sheet';

const App = () => (
  <FancyActionSheetProvider>
    <HomeScreen />
  </FancyActionSheetProvider>
);

const HomeScreen = () => {
  const { showFancyActionSheet } = useFancyActionSheet();

  const handleShowActionSheet = () => {
    showFancyActionSheet({
      title: 'Choose an Option',
      message: 'Please select one of the options below:',
      options: [
        { id: '1', name: 'Option 1' },
        { id: '2', name: 'Option 2' },
        { id: '3', name: 'Delete' },
      ],
      destructiveOptionId: '3',
      onOptionPress: (option) => console.log(`Selected: ${option.name}`),
    });
  };

  return <Button title="Show Action Sheet" onPress={handleShowActionSheet} />;
};

export default App;
```
